# js-tests
Just clone or fork, and `npm i`!

Create a folder for your code e.g. `src`

There's an `index.js` with helper variables & functions. These can be shared across src & test folders.

This is my folder structure:
```
.
|-index.js
|
|-src
  |
  |-grid.js
  |-time.js
|
|-test
  |
  |-grid.test.js
  |-time.test.js
|
|-...
```
